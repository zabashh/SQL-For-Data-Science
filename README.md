This is some analysis i have done on the yelp dataset
Data Profiling and Understanding:

I profiled and understood the Yelp dataset by finding the total number of records for various tables, such as business, category, review, user, etc.
Exploring Open and Closed Businesses:

I grouped businesses into open and closed categories and compared them based on average review counts and star ratings. I also looked at the distribution of business categories for open businesses.
Exploring User Behavior:

I analyzed user data, specifically looking at users with the most fans, and examined whether the number of reviews correlates with the number of fans.
Analyzing Review Text:

I performed a basic text analysis on reviews to count the occurrences of words "love" and "hate."
Further Data Analysis:

I performed additional analyses by choosing specific categories and cities. I compared businesses with 2-3 stars to those with 4-5 stars in terms of their operating hours and review counts.
Estimating Star Ratings:

I estimated star ratings for businesses based on my analysis.
Proposing Further Analysis:

I proposed the idea of predicting the overall star rating for a business and generating a dataset with estimated star ratings.
Throughout these analyses, SQL queries were used to retrieve and manipulate the data, gaining insights into various aspects of the Yelp dataset.
